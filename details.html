<h4>carolina hotel</h4>
<p>The Carolina Hotel sits on the shores of Lake Toba, with direct access to the water for swimming and beautiful gardens in which the ceremony and reception will take place. There is a restaurant with superb views over the lake, and the accommodation, which ranges from large chalet suites for families to individual rooms, displays traditional <emph>gorga</emph> carvings and decoration. The decor inside is admittedly somewhat tired-looking but is more than made up for by the stunning grounds.</p>

<h4>getting there</h4>
<p>Direct flights run regularly between Medan, the provincial capital of North Sumatra, and major cities such as Jakarta, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. From Medan you can find drivers to take you to Lake Toba - it's a popular destination so it won't be difficult.  This will get you to Parapat, the town on the shores of Lake Toba from which you can hop on a ferry to Samosir. The passenger service goes from Pelabuhan Tiga Raja (Three Kings Port) every hour for about 50p, or you can take the the car ferry from Pelabuhan Ajibata.  Carolina Hotel is then just a short drive from the landing point.</p>
<p>We would recommend perhaps breaking up the journey and enjoying a brief stay in Jakarta Singapore/etc. before setting out to Samosir.  It is also worth noting that many of the larger hotels on Samosir offer airport pickup services which may help streamline the procedure.</p>

<h4>itinerary</h4>
<p>We will have a short ceremony starting at 10:00 in the gardens of the hotel involving the exchange of vows and rings and a blessing, followed by photographs. There will then be brief break for the lunch buffet, during which you are welcome, if you wish, to return to your hotels to change, or pick up your swimming gear, or anything else you'd like to do before returning for the reception.  This will also take place in the grounds of the Carolina Hotel as a garden party-style affair with food, drink, music, and a chance to chat with everyone, and to celebrate. This will continue from the afternoon through till late.</p>

<h4>food & drink</h4>
<p>A buffet will be available in the gardens for lunch and dinner. We will be serving Batak and Padang cuisine along with a selection of British desserts.  A representative sample would be babi panggang, saksang, and arsik ikan mas; rendang, bebek cabe ijo, and tempe balado; scones, apple crumble, and Welsh cakes.</p>
<p>As for drink there will be plenty of water and iced tea and other soft drinks available, though with alcoholic drinks a little harder to come by in Indonesia we do ask you to, if possible, please bring a bottle of something with you from home to contribute to the pool.</p>

<h4>dress code</h4>
<p>The dress code is, as you may imagine, summer wedding / formal garden party. It will be hot, though much more comfortable and fresh than elsewhere in Indonesia at around 26°C or so with a far more tolerable humidity. For the reception if you would like then feel free to bring your swimming costume as well, as the garden includes an area to step down to the lake for a dip which we hope to take advantage of later in the afternoon. </p>
