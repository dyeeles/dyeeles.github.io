<h4>carolina hotel</h4>
<p>The Carolina Hotel sits on the shores of Lake Toba, with direct access to the water from the beautifully-kept gardens in which the ceremony and reception will take place.  The accommodation, which ranges from large chalet suites for families down to to individual rooms, is constructed in a style reminiscent of traditional Samosir houses featuring traditional <emph>gorga</emph> carvings on the exterior. The decor inside is admittedly somewhat tired-looking but is more than made up for by the stunning grounds and the surperb view from the restaurant.</p>
<p>We have booked the entire hotel for the 25h and the 26th.  -----Those of you travelling from the UK will get these rooms if you want them, just let us know in the email if you will or will not be taking us up on that offer.  You can then extend your stay before and after as needed.  Also fill up the rest in some way.-----</p>

<h4>getting there</h4>
<p>A simplified route is shown below.  Direct flights run regularly between Medan, the provincial capital of North Sumatra, and major cities such as Jakarta, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. From Medan you will be able to find  drivers to take you to Lake Toba - it's a popular destination so this shouldn't be too difficult.  A three or four hour drive, this will get you to the town of Parapat on the shores of Lake Toba from which you can catch a 15-30 minute ferry ride across to the island of Samosir. The passenger service goes from Tiga Raja port every hour for about 50p, or you can take the car ferry from Ajibata port.  Carolina Hotel is then just a short drive from the landing point.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that many of the larger hotels on Samosir offer airport pickup services which may help streamline the process.  We would also recommend perhaps breaking up the journey and enjoying a brief stay in Jakarta/Singapore/etc. before setting out for Samosir.</p>

<h4>itinerary</h4>
<p>We will have a short ceremony starting at 10:00 in the gardens of the hotel involving the exchange of vows and rings, followed by photographs. The lunch buffet will then be brought out marking the beginning of the reception, a garden party-style affair which will continue until late with food, drink, music, and a chance to chat with everyone, and celebrate in the (hopefully!) lovely weather.  You're more than welcome to pop out and change for the reception at any time if you wish, or to pick up your swimming things for a dip in the lake.  Snacks will of course be available throughout, and a dinner buffet will be brought out in the evening.</p>

<h4>food & drink</h4>
<p>A buffet will be brought out for lunch and dinner consisting of traditional Batak and Padang cuisine, along with a selection of British desserts and of course snacks available throughout.  As for drink there will be plenty of water and iced tea and other soft drinks, though with alcoholic drinks a little harder to come by in Indonesia we do ask you to, if possible, please bring a bottle of something with you from home to contribute to the pool.</p>

<h4>dress code</h4>
<p>The dress code is, as you may imagine, summer wedding / garden party. It will be hot, though much more comfortable than elsewhere in the country at around 26°C or so with a far more tolerable humidity. For the reception if you would like then feel free to bring your swimming costume as well, as the garden includes an area to step down to the lake for a dip which we hope to take advantage of later in the afternoon.</p>
