<h4>carolina hotel</h4>
<p>The Carolina Hotel sits on the shores of Lake Toba, with direct access to the water from the beautifully-kept gardens in which the ceremony and reception will take place.  The accommodation, which ranges from large chalet suites for families down to to individual rooms, is constructed in a style reminiscent of traditional Batak houses featuring intricate <i>gorga</i> carvings on the exterior. The decor inside looks admittedly somewhat tired but is more than made up for by the stunning grounds and the surperb view from the restaurant.</p>
<p>We have booked the entire hotel for the 25th and the 26th.  These rooms will be available on a first-com-first-served basis, so if you would like one of these please just let us know in your RSVP email.  You are then able to extend your stay before or after these dates by booking with the hotel.</p>

<h4>getting there</h4>
<p>A simplified route for getting to the venue is shown below.  Direct flights run regularly between Medan, the provincial capital of North Sumatra, and major cities such as Jakarta, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. From Medan you will be able to find  drivers to take you to Lake Toba - Nice Trans operate shared taxis all the way there (though this may or may not include stopping in Pematang Siantar for lunch with the driver) for approximately £10.  A three or four hour drive, this will get you to the town of Parapat on the shores of Lake Toba from which you can catch a 15-30 minute ferry ride across to the island of Samosir. The passenger service goes from Tiga Raja port every hour for about 50p, or you can take the car ferry from Ajibata port.  Carolina Hotel is then just a short drive from the landing point.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that many of the larger hotels on Samosir offer airport pickup services which may help streamline the process.  We would also recommend perhaps breaking up the journey and enjoying a brief stay in Jakarta/Singapore/etc. before setting out for Samosir.</p>

<h4>itinerary</h4>
<p>We will have a short ceremony starting at 10:00 in the gardens of the hotel involving the exchange of vows and rings, followed by photographs. The lunch buffet will then be brought out marking the beginning of the reception, a garden party-style affair which will continue until late with food, drink, music, and a chance to chat with everyone, and celebrate in the (hopefully!) lovely weather.  You're more than welcome to pop out and change for the reception at any time if you wish to do so, or to pick up your swimming things for a dip in the lake.  Snacks will of course be available throughout, and a dinner buffet will be brought out in the evening.</p>

<h4>food & drink</h4>
<p>A buffet will be brought out for lunch and dinner consisting of traditional Batak and Padang cuisine, along with a selection of British desserts and of course snacks available throughout the day.  As for drink there will be plenty of water and iced tea and other soft drinks, though with alcohol a little harder to come by in Indonesia we do ask you to, if possible, please bring a bottle of something with you from home to contribute to the pool.  We will however have sourced a few botles of <i>tuak</i>, the local tipple made from palm sap.</p>

<h4>dress code</h4>
<p>The dress code is, as you may imagine, summer wedding / garden party. It will be hot, though much more comfortable than elsewhere in the country at around 26°C or so with a far more tolerable humidity. For the reception if you would like then feel free to bring your swimming costume as well, as the garden includes an area to step down to the lake for a dip which we hope to take advantage of later in the afternoon.</p>
