<h4>about samosir</h4>
<p>Samosir is an island in the centre of Lake Toba, a vast body of water occupying the crater of a supervolcano that erupted 75,000 years ago. Together they represent both the world's largest volcanic lake and the largest island-in-a-lake-in-an-island. Famed for its natural beauty and temperate climate, the region is also known for being the ancestral home of the Toba Batak people who settled Samosir and established the surrounding coastal settlements approximately a thousand years ago. Siraja Batak, the mythohistorical common ancestor to all Batak and founder of the civilisation, lived on Samosir as did the famed resistance leader Sisingamangaraja XII, the last priest-king of the Batak people, who died fighting for independence from the Dutch. It remains to this day the centre of Batak culture, holding special significance accordingly.</p>

<h4>transport</h4>
<p>Getting around the island is easy on moped or on bike, which your hotel should be able to help organise. The easiest (and most enjoyable) mode of public trasport is probably hailing a becak if you can find one, and there are public minibus routes around the island. It will be quite hot for walking too far but if you do get a chance it's well worth it for the views. The popular Uber-style app-based taxi services Grab and Gojek are very good options offering cheap transport wherever you might wish to go either by car or on the back of a moped.  Last time we visited these were ubiquitous on the mainland but somewhat limited on Samosir itself, though this may well have changed since then.</p>

<h4>restaurants</h4>
<p>Given its status as a bit of a tourist destination there are many restaurants catering to international visitors that offer standard fare like pizza and burgers, mainly found at the larger hotels. There are of course many restaurants offering Indonesian cuisine, but more uniquely you can find a great deal of Batak restaurants specialising in grilled pork, Lake Toba carp, blood curry, and the iconic flavour of <i>andaliman<i> that is ubiquitous in Batak food.  These small cafés and restaurants can be found all over.  A representative sample of the more restauranty places would be:
  <ul>
    <li>Yolanda Restaurant,</li>
    <li>LEO'S Restaurant,</li>
    <li>Rosalie Beer Garden & Restaurant,</li>
    <li>Alyssa Restaurant,</li>
    <li>Maruba,</li>

<h4>local attractions</h4>
<p>Samosir and the greater Lake Toba area is a popular tourist destination but isn't quite so well known outside of the country in comparison to places like Bali. It enjoyed a degree of popularity in the 1990s and the local government is aiming to promote the area heavily in the coming years; as such it is nicely set up for international tourists, particularly on Samosir itself, while remaining nicely down to earth.</p>
<p>Chief among the local tourist attractions are the Batak Museum in Tomok which features the tomb of King Sidabutar, performances of the traditional <i>sigale-gale</i> funeral puppet dance, and a neighbouring souvenir market. There is also the museum-village of Huta Siallagan where you can see traditional Batak houses and learn about daily life in the past.
<p>There are a number of freshwater beaches scattered around the island, viewpoints up in the central highlands, and the natural hot springs of Aek Rangat Pangaruran to enjoy.  Various boat trips and activities on the water can be found through local providers, including fishing, banana boating, jetskiing, or simply taking a short boat trip.  The <i>kapal wisata Samosir</i> is a boat shaped like a traditional Batak house with two giant funeral puppets at the bow that offers cruises around the lake.</p>
<p>Back on the mainland you have the coastal towns of Balige and Parapat, which are fun to explore though not particularly touristy.  One attraction of particular note is the house that Indonesia's first president, Soekarno, was exiled to for fomenting revolution against the Dutch (<i>Rumah Pengasingan Soekarno</i>).  The road down the side of the crater that leads to/from Parapat offers stunning views, roadside cafés from which to enjoy them, and a local population of monkeys. The largest city in the region is Medan which you will pass through on your way in and out, followed by Pematang Siantar.  Other interesting sites in the area include the naturally-fizzy hot spring of Parbubu near Tarutung, the viewpoints at Bukit Holbung and Bukit Indah Simarjarunjung, and the forested hill trail of Salib Kasih, a tribute to the German missionary Ludwig Nommensen.</p>
